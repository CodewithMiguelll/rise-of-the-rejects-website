# 🌌 Rise of the Rejects — Website  

*"Order. Progress. Unity."* That’s what the Uppers promised. But in the ashes of Nigeria’s freedom, three factions emerged:  
- **Uppers** — the elite, ruling with iron fists and golden lies.  
- **Lowers** — the working class, crushed under the weight of their labor.  
- **Rejects** — the forgotten, cast aside, but burning with rebellion.  

This repo holds the **official digital home** of *Rise of the Rejects* (ROTR)—a dystopian saga brought to life on the web.
